# Chapter 1: Introduction
## 1.1 Background
“I do not fear the man who has practiced 10000 types of kicks one time, but the man who has trained 1 kick 10000 times.” 					~ Bruce lee

Within the realm of fitness and training, many individuals encounter challenges related to monitoring and feedback, which often lead to inconsistencies in their exercise routines. "AI-based Mentor for MMA," abbreviated as AIMMMA, is an application developed to offer users a simple yet valuable tool for tracking and enhancing their fitness experiences. While the initial focus of this application revolves around fundamental exercises such as punches, kicks, pushups, squats, and their combinations, its primary aim is to provide users with an accessible platform for monitoring, evaluating and tracking their progress.

In today's fitness landscape, an abundance of high-tech fitness apps and devices are available. However, these tools often fall short in delivering personalised guidance and feedback tailored to individual needs and goals. AIMMMA recognizes these limitations and endeavours to address them by concentrating on tracking body movement using Computer vision.

What sets this application apart is its dedication to providing a straightforward and user-friendly experience. Its core functionality centres around tracking and recording basic exercises using Computer vision that constitute vital components of MMA training. Users can depend on the application to accurately monitor, log and analyse their punches, kicks, pushups, squats, and combinations thereof. 

The primary objective of this application is to assist users in maintaining a consistent fitness routine by furnishing them with a convenient tool for tracking their workouts and seamlessly getting real-time audio feedback. It is important to emphasise that the application does not seek to replace the physical effort required for exercise but rather aims to enhance it by offering a convenient means of progress tracking. 

While future iterations of the application may consider expanding its features and capabilities, the current version provides a practical solution for individuals seeking to monitor their performance in fundamental exercises. The application remains committed to delivering a straightforward and user-centric experience, making it an accessible choice for those interested in basic MMA-inspired workouts.

It allows the frontend to receive updates from the core component without having to send a request. This makes it possible to create a more responsive and interactive user experience.

# Chapter 3: Requirement and System Analysis

## 3.1 Problem Definition

Current systems lack the ability to track body pose and classify exercises effectively. They do not analyze the speed of movements, monitor reps and sets using AI technology, and often require manual input from the user. This can lead to inaccurate tracking and a loss of crucial real-time feedback on form and speed of exercises.

## 3.1.2 Existing System

Existing AI-powered fitness apps can design effective diet and workout plans based on user data, biological facts, and expert opinions. Some apps can track progress, but this may require manual input. Other apps integrate with wearables to track progress. Some apps provide video or 3D instructions on how to do exercises properly. Most apps use scientific data to provide general workout and diet plans and track progress. Few apps have body tracking capabilities, but this is not a core feature.

# Chapter 4: System Design

## 4.1 Basic Modules

* **Pose Classification and Research Interface:** This module uses the ml5 and p5 libraries to provide a rough prototypical interface on a white canvas. The p5 library enables artists, designers, and engineers to develop quick interfaces for faster prototyping ideas. ml5 and p5 together can be used to create a sophisticated interface to train various models for this application.
* **Reps Analyzer:** This module uses neural networks to detect reps (counts of any exercise that the system is designed to classify) in a given stream of raw data.
* **Sets Analyzer:** This module uses neural networks to detect sets (collections of reps and rests on the exercises that the system is designed to classify) in a given stream of analyzed rep data.
* **Tempo Analyzer:** This module keeps track of the tempo of each rep that is analyzed from the Reps Analyzer.
* **Recorder:** This module requires access to the camera API in a web browser that supports Javascript Web APIs on a device with a camera. It is accessed by many of the detectors and not only records but streams data to various processes from front-end to back-end and from back-end to various modules.
* **Storage:** This module handles all the storage related to operations, saving user generated and computer generated data for future analysis.
* **Audio Feedback:** This front-end module constantly listens to the backend updates using websockets technology. Controlled by the backend modules (analyzers), it stores and plays appropriate pre-recorded audio cues for any feedback.

## 4.4 User Interface Design



## 4.5 Security Issues

* **Data collection and storage:** AI-based fitness tracking applications collect a large amount of personal data, including body measurements, activity levels, and location data. This data can be used to track users' movements and habits, and it could potentially be misused or sold to third parties without users' consent.

**Mitigation:**

* The application should only collect the data that is necessary for its intended purpose.
* The application should clearly inform users about what data is being collected and how it will be used.
* The application should give users control over their data, including the ability to opt out of data collection and to request that their data be deleted.
* The application should use strong encryption to protect user data.

* **Data security:** AI-based fitness tracking applications store a large amount of sensitive data, and they must be properly secured to protect it from unauthorized access, theft, or loss. If this data is compromised, it could be used for identity theft, fraud, or other malicious purposes.

**Mitigation:**

* The application should be hosted on a secure server.
* The application should use strong passwords and other authentication measures to protect user accounts.
* The application should be regularly updated with security patches.

* **Model bias:** AI-based fitness tracking applications use machine learning models to track and analyze user data. These models can be biased, which could lead to inaccurate or unfair results. For example, a model that is trained on data from primarily male athletes may not be able to accurately track the performance of female athletes.

**Mitigation:**

* The application should use machine learning models that are trained on a diverse dataset.
* The application should regularly evaluate the accuracy of its models and make adjustments as needed.

* **Feedback accuracy:** AI-based fitness tracking applications provide users with feedback on their form and technique. However, the accuracy of this feedback may vary depending on the quality of the application's AI models. If the feedback is inaccurate, it could lead to users developing bad habits or even injuring themselves.

**Mitigation:**

* The application should use AI models that have been trained on a large dataset of accurate feedback from experts.
* The application should provide users with the ability to rate the accuracy of the feedback they receive.
* The application should clearly inform users
